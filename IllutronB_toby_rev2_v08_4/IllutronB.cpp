//
// IllutronB Wave Table Synthesizer Based on the original Illutron synthesiser work of Nikolaj Mobius
//
// Refactored and optimised and documented by Duane B aka RCArduino
// 
// Differences from original Illutron -
//
// The synthesisor is now encapsulated in two classes - CIllutronB and a nested class CIllutronB::CVoice
//
// The voice class contains the parameters of each of the musical channels/tracks/voices - if you are
// not of a musical background you can think of each voice as a separate instrument. The voice class 
// also performs the calculations required to generate the sound for each voice/instrument when it is asked by the containing
// CIllutronB class
//
// The CIllutronB class implements the main synthesisor functions which are - 
//
// 1) Containing the voices that make up the synth sound
// 2) Asking the voices to calculate thier output whenever the synth needs to update the sound - so thats 8,000 times a second !
// 3) Performing additional calculations on the voice outputs to generate the sound - scaling them so that they can share one 8 bit channel
// 4) Generating the output - its incedible, but the entire sound of the synth including the four independent channels is being output through PWM on one 8 bit timer - digital pin 6
// 5) Providing a tempo - the user can update the Beats per minute at any time by calling - setBPM - the pitch will not change, just the speed
//
// Note that a squencer is not currently provided within CIllutronB - it would be a logical development to provide an additional sequencer class
// It would also be logical to provide a class for storing and retreiving voices. But lets get creating first.
